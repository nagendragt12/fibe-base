Task 1 - Creating the Login and Registration Page with Firebase Authentication
Setup Firebase Authentication
Go to the Firebase Console and select your project.
Navigate to the Authentication section and enable Email/Password sign-in method.
Implementing the Login and Registration Page
Registration Page: Create a form that collects the user's email and password. Upon submission, call Firebase's createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) function to register the user.
Login Page: Create a form that asks for the user's email and password. On form submission, call Firebase's signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password) function to authenticate the user.
Security Rules
Ensure your Firebase security rules allow read/write access to authenticated users only.

Task 2 - Converting the Design to React
Setting Up the React Project
Set up a new React project using Create React App.
Install Firebase SDK and configure Firebase in your React app.
Converting the Design
Convert the HTML/CSS design to React components.
Implement Firebase Authentication logic as described in Task 1.
Conclusion
This project showcases how to integrate Firebase Authentication into a web application for user management. By following the instructions provided, you can create a functional login and registration system and convert the design to React.
